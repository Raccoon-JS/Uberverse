# Initial goals

Joseph Vámosi wanted to spend a portion of his money on the betterment of humanity and furthering civil rights. He had concerns,
that radicalization might have a net negative effect on the process, and might create a reaction that can undo what have been 
done up to that day.

Besides of setting up "Human Rights Center", he had plans on forming multiple groups for disadvantaged übermensch of various 
backgrounds, with the intention of stop them from running amok and channel their energy to whatever he thought was the best for
them.

# Foundation

The first branch was formed in 1985, in the USA. While they successfully stopped a few right-wing radicals, the group was 
dismissed by black radicals and other leftists on the basis of being horribly ineffective in stopping them within the legal
framework.

Western-Europe got them between 1986-1988. South American branches opened up in 1987 in a few countries. Eastern-European 
branches were repurposed from earlier groups set to ensure that the system change went within the values of "capitalism and free
democracy", by the year 1993. A Japanese branch opened in 1995, but quickly went into illegality due to laws made after the Tokyo
Subway Terrorist Attacks.

In the nineties, there were a few controversies around gaining right to policing, and heavy cooperation with the police, and 
often were called as paramilitary groups. Almost all members were anonymous, which drew suspicion from the public, especially
the right. Despite all of this, multiple more donor companies have supported them.

# Downfall

The subsidies slowly lost donors as the companies either changed their political views (usually by supporting ultraconservative
and fascist movements) or went into bankrupcy in the Economic Crash of 2008.

Joseph Vámosi remained a donor until his assassination. After that, a few subsidiaries completely disbanded, while others 
remainedwith the leaders slowly losing control over the members, who often dropped the nonviolence, with a few even resorting 
to murder, especially after many goups became illegal.

# Known equipment

* Communication devices, some of which include ones that use special satellites.
* Computers
* Armor

## Weapons

Weapon donation and aquisition were very scarce. Most weapons owned by any Brotherhood branches were either preowned by the 
police, or in the case of Eastern-European groups, leftovers from the previous era of the groups. Once certain subsidies went
illegal, they started to accumulate old military equipment, including weapons.
