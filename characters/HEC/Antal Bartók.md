# Early Life
Born in the Transylvanian region in Romania, Antal Bartok and his family 
relocated to a border town in Hungary during Nicolae Ceausescu's 
Romanianization campaign.

(writer's note: I thought giving a bigoted character a backstory of 
being a victim of real-life tragedy involving ethno-national identity 
and categorization.)

Antal Bartok's father, Janos, got a job as the secret police that 
watched over political dissidents - especially those who were 
ubermensch. That made Bartok interested in politics but developed a 
desire for absolute power, and beginning to believe that Socialist 
government not adopting Soviet-style ruling made Hungary worse. Not only 
that, he adopted a very fascistic, ethno-nationalistic worldview that 
Hungarians are superior than any ethnic demographic in Europe, and 
(privately) romanticize the Fascist regime from the past.

(writer's note: Did some research into Goulash Communism. To be honest, 
as an outsider, I was surprised how it's different than American 
perception of Eastern Bloc countries. But if there's someone in Hungary 
who has somewhat a nuanced perspective on that era and how people 
beginning to adopt ultra-nationalist ideology.)

## How he became anti-Ubermensch
To make long story short, he adopted his father's authoritarianism and 
wanted to follow his footstep of becoming a beaucrat that surveils 
ethnic minorities. When Hungarian Eugenics Committee was created during 
the liberalization, he became one of earliest applicants and goes around 
collecting DNA samples from various people.
