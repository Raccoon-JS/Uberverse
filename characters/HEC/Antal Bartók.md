# Early Life
Born in the Transylvanian region in Romania, Antal Bartok and his family 
relocated to a border town in Hungary during Nicolae Ceausescu's 
Romanianization campaign.

(writer's note: I thought giving a bigoted character a backstory of 
being a victim of real-life tragedy involving ethno-national identity 
and categorization.)

Antal Bartok's father, Janos, got a job as the secret police that 
watched over political dissidents - especially those who were 
ubermensch. That made Bartok interested in politics but developed a 
desire for absolute power, and beginning to believe that Socialist 
government not adopting Soviet-style rule made Hungary worse. Not only 
that, he adopted a very ethno-nationalistic worldview that Hungarians 
are superior than any ethnic demographic in Europe.

(writer's note: Did some research into Goulash Communism. To be honest, 
as an outsider, I was surprised how it's different than American 
perception of Eastern Bloc countries. But if there's someone in Hungary 
who has somewhat a nuanced perspective on that era and how people 
beginning to adopt ultra-nationalist ideology.)
