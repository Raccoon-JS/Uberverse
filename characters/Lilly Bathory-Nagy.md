# Early life

Born into a family of moderately rich, socially liberal entreprenurs, one of which was the descedant of vampire baroness, 
Erzsébet Báthory. Lilly kept the fact that she's a vampire a secret, mostly by claiming she can't step outside without any 
protection due to her albinism. She often looked with jealousy at others as she can't eat regular food, and instead needs blood.

### Car "accident" and death of mother

At the age of 5, she and her mother were travelling long-distance in a car at winter, but then the car got impaled by a lot of 
metal rods that fell off from a truck. Her mother died due to her vital organs were pierced by them.

Lilly - thanks to her shorter size and using her telekinesis to redirect the metal rods, all she got is just a temporary loss of 
an arm, that she regrew with her regeneration powers right after she left the car while crying after her mother.

For a lot of people the accident itself seem to be staged, since the truck was owned by one of the companies of the man, who 
wanted to buy up the company owned by Lilly's parents. The conspiracy theory sperading on early Hungarian internet however made
the group to postpone the buy up, to an undecided time, which ended up being "never".

### Growing discrimination

While her light skin and other unique features were considered to be "pretty" by her age group, things started to change as she 
got older and HEC (Hungarian Eugenics Commitee - Magyar Eugenikai Tanács) started various propaganda about "genetic diseases" to
school children. This slowly changes the attitude towards her, which isn't helped by the fact that she's looks a bit 
underweight. LGBTQ+ phobia was also on the rapid rise, and she just were realizing her bisexuality as she entered puberty.

# Attack on HEC headquarters

### Prelude

After getting into a relatively elite secondary school, she had suspicions around her lack of menstruation, so she looked up a 
doctor to get it sorted out. However, this meant that she will get registered in the HEC and will get a DNA test for genetic 
diseases and other things due to laws related to healthcare funding.

While it was promised that she will get the results and the eugenics classification within a week, she didn't received anything.
Instead a cop came to her home, picked her up, and took her to a forest. He was supposed to kill her, then frame the murder onto an
unknown suspect, but he broke down mentally over the whole thing, then Lilly altered his memories to get away from the cop.

### On the run

With the assumption of her being dead from the agencies trying to kill her, she had some time on her hand. The only clue on who
and why wanted her to be dead was just an e-mail address ending with `hec.gov`.
