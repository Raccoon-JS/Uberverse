# Early life

Born into a family of moderately rich, socially liberal entreprenurs, one of which was the descedant of vampire baroness, 
Erzsébet Báthory. Lilly kept the fact that she's a vampire a secret, mostly by claiming she can't step outside without any 
protection due to her albinism. She often looked with jealousy at others as she can't eat regular food, and instead needs blood.

### Car "accident" and death of mother

At the age of 5, she and her mother were travelling long-distance in a car at winter, but then the car got impaled by a lot of 
metal rods that fell off from a truck. Her mother died due to her vital organs were pierced by them.

Lilly - thanks to her shorter size and using her telekinesis to redirect the metal rods, all she got is just a temporary loss of 
an arm, that she regrew with her regeneration powers right after she left the car while crying after her mother.

For a lot of people the accident itself seem to be staged, since the truck was owned by one of the companies of the man, who 
wanted to buy up the company owned by Lilly's parents. The conspiracy theory sperading on early Hungarian internet however made
the group to postpone the buy up, to an undecided time, which ended up being "never".

### Growing discrimination

While her light skin and other unique features were considered to be "pretty" by her age group, things started to change as she 
got older and HUC (Hungarian Eugenics Comitee - Magyar Eugenikai Tanács) started various propaganda about "genetic diseases" to
school children. This slowly changes the attitude towards her, which isn't helped by the fact that she's looks a bit 
underweight.
