# Early life

Viktor Szalontai was born into a middle-class family, that quickly wen impoverished due to multiple circumstances. This caused his
father to become an alcoholic and a gambling addict.

He used to have a minor speech impairment as a child, which lead to bullying. This became unmanageable in secondary school, due to
false information about disabilities and welfare queens that were left over from previous propaganda of the far-right parties of 
Hungary. While he somehow overcame it, this all just lead to even more bullying thanks to one of his then classmate's (NTBD) neo-
fascist views. Thanks to an incident where a disabled student got killed by their bullies and the bullies were pardoned by their 
judge because "they were just playing", the classmates of Viktor planned to murder him. However, Viktor just gained his powers the
day before the event, but he had no experience in properly controlling his powers. This resulted in killing most of his bullies - 
except for NTBD, who was absent on that day - and burning his school down.

# Joining the Brotherhood

After the incident, he got visited by the leader of the Hungarian branch of the Brotherhood, and got given two choices: he either 
go in prison for his crimes and deal with the effects of it, or join the Brotherhood and this incident will be covered up. Knowing
that if even he somehow survives the prison he has no future, he chose the latter option. He will go under the name "Prometheus".
